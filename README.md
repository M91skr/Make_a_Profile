## Make a Profile

## Description
In this site, we use Flask to create a site where the user can log in and see their security information.
To create the following site, I took help from the following documents:
Using wtf ðŸ˜‚: https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/forms/;
Definition of functional fields: https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/fields/#wtforms.fields.SelectField;
Validation of fields: https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/validators/#module-wtforms.validators;
Error handling: https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/crash_course/#displaying-errors;
(Create more attractive UX: https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/basic-usage.html)


## How to run
run following:
```bash
python -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```
